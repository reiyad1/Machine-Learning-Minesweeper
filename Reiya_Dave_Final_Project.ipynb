Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization, which helps to stabilize the training process.

If it is not a mine, then the playing board is updated with the clue value of the cell. For following iterations, the trained CNN model will output the probabilities that each cell is a mine, with the highest probabilities meaning that the cell is more likely to be a mine and the lowest probabilities meaning that the cell is more likely to be safe. From there, the agent looks at the probabilities of the remaining cells of our playing board and chooses the cell with the lowest probability to click on. We also keep track of how many cells are clicked and check that with the total amount of safe cells in the board, so that if those two values are equal, then the agent has won the game and cleared the board."

        "As you can see from the results above, the model did not have good losses when trained on the data for easy, intermediate, and expert level boards. I believe this has to do with my training data generation. I think that because the logic bot that I created based on the pseudocode given in the writeup was not able to win many games (usually 8/9 games won on easy boards out of 100 games), the models were not able to perform well either. For each board level training, the loss stayed generally the same. For comparing the performance of the logic bot with the network, I used number of games won and average steps taken before hitting a mine. Both of my bots did not continue playing the game after a they hit a mine, so I did not use average number of mines hit before game ends as a metric. As you can see above, the logic bot performs better than my network bot in all difficulty levels, but are closer in performance for the expert board."

From task 1, a few things have to change to adjust to these parameters. The biggest change to adjust to variable mines is to have the model be trained on data where we have boards of size 30x30 with variable numbers of mines. Previously, the models were trained separately for easy, intermediate, and expert boards where each type of board had a set number of mines and each model was only fit for its corresponding difficulty. Now, I will generate data for 30x30 boards that have 0% to 30% of the board covered in mines and I will train a model on that data. I will then compare the performance of the trained model and the logic bot on 100 boards and compare."

        "As you can see from the results above, the loss during training decreased slightly, but not that much. The performance for both the logic bot and the network bot was bad, as they both won very small amounts of games out of 100. In terms of average steps before hitting a mine, the plot above shows that the network bot had a lower number of steps taken before hitting a mine compared to the logic bot, which shows the poor performance. I think I can attribute this poor performance to the training data generation and how I used my logic bot to generate data, which may not have been the best approach given the fact that the logic bot did not perform well when playing Minesweeper in general."

        "Below is the model for playing minesweeper on varying board sizes. This network is different from the previous ones, as I implement transformer layers to account for input tensors of varying sizes. The previous models worked best for data where the input tensor was the same size across all data, so this new model adjusts for varying tensor sizes through the use of transformer layers. The network starts with an embedding layer (same as the previous models) that is used for encoding cell states. The embedded representation is then passed through transformer layers (I settled on using 2 layers due to memory usage), which help the model focus on key areas of the inputted game state by using self-attention mechanisms. Then, the tensor is passed through a linear layer that is dynamically created in the forward pass rather than the initial architecture to account for input tensors of varying sizes."

        "As you can see above, I was unable to run my CNN for task 3. I ran into issues regarding my network because I was attempting to use transformer layers to have a better model architecture for minesweeper boards of varying sizes. I decided to use transformer layers because of its ability to capture long-range dependencies and adapt to inputs of varied sizes. Transformers are generally used for the understanding of spatial relationships between different parts of the input, which is something that is important for Minesweeper because the location of mines may often depend on cells that are further away. Transformers are also able to naturally handle inputs of varying sizes, which is why utilizing those layers in my model for task 3 was important. Unfortunately, I struggled with training the model, due to the issue with my GPU memory running out of space, so I could not test out the performance of the improved model with the logic bot, but my hope is that my improved model would perform better than the logic bot. This, however, is largely based on how good the training data is, and in my case, my training data was not always the best due to my logic bot not winning many games.\n"

        "You could approach the problem of generating good board to play on by building a generative model based on neural networks. You could develop something where the input could be a set board size and the output would be a corresponding Minesweeper board. The neural network would then be trained on boards that previous bots performed well on, which would then result in a neural network model that performs well and plays Minesweeper well. You could evaluate the quality of the generated boards by comparing them to other previous successful boards and look at mine placements as well as the amount of clear cells around the mines to see if the generated boards are of good quality. This would allow us to make sure that the model produces boards that are accurate to what a Minesweeper board would be without making the boards too easy to win."
